## Project summary

### Overview

Netcon is a Windows-based system designed to address the manual and tedious task of reconfiguring devices experiencing network issues at the airport. Developed during my internship JKIA's IT department, Netcon aims to automate the detection and resolution of common network problems, enhancing efficiency and reducing the workload associated with manual interventions.

### Objectives

- Automation of Device Reconfiguration: Netcon automates the process of detecting and reconfiguring devices that encounter network issues, such as unidentified networks or disconnection.

- Email Notification System: In addition to resolving issues, Netcon sends email notifications to the ICT office, providing details about the identified problem and the new configuration parameters applied.

### Key Features
- Automatic Issue Detection: Netcon autonomously identifies common network problems, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
- Configuration Parameter Updates: Devices are reconfigured with updated parameters to restore seamless network connectivity.
- Email Notifications: Netcon sends real-time email notifications to the ICT office, facilitating prompt awareness and action.

More detail is available in our [description document](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md).
